I love you, buddy! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

But I've never been to the moon! Why not indeed! OK, this has gotta stop. **I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.** _With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!_ Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!

## Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.

Also Zoidberg. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Take me to your leader! Soothe us with sweet lies.

1. No argument here.
2. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!
3. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

### Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?

A sexy mistake. Throw her in the brig. Belligerent and numerous. Then we'll go with that data file! Tell them I hate them. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

- Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
- I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?
- Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.

No. We're on the top. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. So, how 'bout them Knicks? Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.

Ow, my spirit! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. They're like sex, except I'm having them!

Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! No argument here.

Tell her she looks thin. Take me to your leader! No, I'm Santa Claus! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

Hello, little man. I will destroy you! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! I don't want to be rescued. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.

OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Who are you, my warranty?! With gusto. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

She also liked to shut up! It's toe-tappingly tragic! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?

When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.

I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Hey, guess what you're accessories to.
